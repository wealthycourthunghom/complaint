Before 2009, it was normal, and mgt fee (i forgot
exactly, maybe $20 or $300 something) then it
changed 管理公司, then a few big jump of mgt fee (i forgot, say $500, then $700 then...to $1018). Then in 2022, it need increase by 20%, to over $1200 per month.
Is it reasonable to hv monthly mgt fee $3- $4 per feet?
Is other building also 10-20% increase in mgt fee per 1-2 year?

In 2024 January, it increase by 8% again.
I heard no other building is like these. 

When talk about this with classmates, they think it was impossible.

There is not much job guaranteed 10-20% increase per 1-2 year.
But mgt fee in this building is 10-20% increase per 1-2 year.
Could any one withstand these kind of mgt fee increase
rate?
